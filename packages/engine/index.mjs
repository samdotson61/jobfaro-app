// EXACT same scoring / gating / level-filtering the CLI runs — no forked re-implementation. The CLI still
// imports lib/ directly; this package is what the web/native apps import (via the pnpm workspace, so Metro
// resolves it as a real node_module). fs/config-coupled modules (the pipeline/outreach/customize stores)
// stay in lib and are reached through the app's own Store adapter — they are NOT part of this surface.
