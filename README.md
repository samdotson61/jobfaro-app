# Jobfaro

**🇺🇸 English** · [🇲🇽 Español](README.es.md)

A bilingual (American English / Español) US job-search command center for **new grads and people breaking
into the workforce** — including those **without a college degree**. **Region-adaptable** (Midwest by
default; toggle to South, Southwest, Northeast, West, or nationwide) and **entry-level by default** (toggle
to mid-level, and senior when you choose it).

Jobfaro scans company career pages (with first-class support for **Workday** and **iCIMS**, the ATSs that
dominate US enterprise employers), evaluates each role against your résumé, tailors an ATS-friendly CV and
cover letter, and tracks every application.

> **Status:** Phases 0–7, 5.5, 7.7, 7.8, 8b, 8a, 8c, 8e + 8f **complete**, **Phase 10 L0–L5 shipped** —
> **Jobfaro CLI `1.51.0`** + **app `1.18.0`**: bilingual core; **six live-verified
> scanner providers** (Workday, iCIMS, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby + an opt-in JSON-LD reader) plus an opt-in
> **USAJobs** federal aggregator (BYO free key); level + region
> toggles and the `jobfaro init` wizard; the full **discover → prescreen → evaluate → track → build** pipeline —
> `scan` finds and filters roles (it never scores), `jobfaro prescreen` **gates + ranks the queue zero-token**
> (hard gates screen with a quoted reason, never silently), the model's `jobfaro eval` scores fit (0–5 →
> Apply / Research / Don't) and records it — one role or **`--next N` batches** (5/10/15… capped at 50)
> behind a **radar progress bar**, every eval ending with **where your jobs report lives** — you advance
> status (`a` in the TUI or `jobfaro tracker --set`),
> `jobfaro outreach` finds the **warm contact** and keeps follow-ups polite by construction, and `jobfaro pdf`
> builds the tailored ATS résumé; a scrollable cursor-driven `jobfaro tui` workspace + a web dashboard with
> analytics; freshness tracking (`posted` / `first_seen`, `scan --prune`). And the **iPhone app now runs
> the whole pipeline fully on the phone** — native scanning, on-device eval/tailor/outreach via llama.rn,
> an in-app model manager — **no Mac, no server; a TestFlight beta is the next step**. Remaining for the
> 1.0 CLI ship: npm publish + marketplace, then a closed beta. See **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** for the
> full build plan and **[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)** for what's shipped.

## Your data stays local

Your résumé and history stay **on your device** (or in your browser, for the web app). The model that does
the thinking is **swappable**:

- **On-device model by default** — private, no API key, no cost (great for non-technical users).
- **API plugin (opt-in)** — bring your own key for higher accuracy; only the minimal slice is sent, with
  zero-retention.
- **Confidential-cloud** — a later option for cloud quality the operator can't read.

The scanner only ever touches **public** job listings — never your résumé — so **we host no personal data**.
That protects your privacy and limits our liability. See **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)** and
**[Legal & responsible use](docs/legal.md)** for the full posture (zero telemetry, SSRF-guarded scanners).

**Your profile never reaches a repo.** `config/profile.yml` (name, metro, salary target — built by
`jobfaro init` from your answers or uploaded résumé) and `config/portals.yml` (the employers you're
targeting) are **gitignored and excluded from the npm package**; the repo ships only PII-free
`*.example.yml` templates. Your résumé (`data/cv.md`), API key, and pipeline live under the gitignored
`data/` dir.

**Portable between devices.** All your data lives in one *user data home*: fresh installs (including
the one-command installer) use `~/.jobfaro` — kept apart from the code, so updates can never wipe it —
while a checkout that already has `config/profile.yml` keeps everything inside that folder (a
self-contained, movable unit), and **`JOBFARO_HOME`** relocates it anywhere. Moving machines = copying
one folder; `jobfaro doctor` shows the active home. Language tables and the employer catalog ship with
the code, so they work from any location.

## Three surfaces, one engine

- **CLI (available now — the backbone)** — local-first. Scanning, prescreening, and tracking need no
  model; `jobfaro backend --install` adds the free private on-device model for eval/tailor, or bring your
  own AI CLI/API.
- **iPhone app (beta soon — the easiest way to try Jobfaro)** — the whole pipeline runs **on the phone**:
  scan → prescreen → evaluate → tailor → outreach, with the model downloaded in-app. No Mac, no server,
  no account; your résumé never leaves the device. A **TestFlight beta** is the next step
  ([Phase 10](ROADMAP.md#phase-10--fully-local-iphone-active-direction-locked-2026-07-08)); Android
  follows on the same stack.
- **Web app (later — [Phase 9](ROADMAP.md#phase-9--web-and-mobile-apps-future--post-10), jobfaro.ai)** — a
  hosted, cross-platform, bilingual app for non-technical users: upload a résumé, get pointed toward
  fitting jobs with little effort. Evaluation stays **on your side** by default, so the résumé never
  leaves your device. Targets: **ease of use** and **accuracy**.

## Using the CLI

`jobfaro` is one command with simple subcommands — and `jf` is its short alias (`jf scan` ≡ `jobfaro scan`):

```bash
jobfaro init           # bilingual setup wizard (region, level, profile)
jobfaro scan           # scan portals for new roles (no model needed)
jobfaro seed --region midwest --write   # add real employers for your region
jobfaro prescreen      # gate + rank pending roles by likelihood (no model needed)
jobfaro eval <url>     # evaluate a role against your résumé
jobfaro eval --next 10 # auto-score the 10 best pending (5, 10, 15 … up to 50) — radar bar included
jobfaro pipeline       # scan -> evaluate -> track, end to end
jobfaro tailor [company] # AI: role-targeted CV summary + cover letter (grounded, local model)
jobfaro pdf [company]  # tailored ATS résumé → output/ (HTML, +PDF with Playwright)
jobfaro outreach <url> # find people to contact about a role; polite follow-ups, enforced
jobfaro tracker        # view your applications
jobfaro dashboard      # localhost web view of your pipeline
jobfaro tui            # interactive terminal dashboard
jobfaro doctor         # check your setup
```

**Install (works today):**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samdotson61/jobfaro-app/main/install.sh | bash
```

Windows (PowerShell): `irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samdotson61/jobfaro-app/main/install.ps1 | iex`.
No installer? `git clone https://github.com/samdotson61/jobfaro-app && cd jobfaro-app && npm install &&
node bin/jobfaro init`. (`npm i -g jobfaro` / `npx jobfaro` arrive with the 1.0 npm publish —
see [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md).) Inside an AI CLI like Claude Code, the same actions are available as
the slash command `/jobfaro scan`, `/jobfaro eval`, and so on.

New here? The **[Getting Started guide](docs/getting-started.md)** is the 5-minute path from install to
your first scan — `jobfaro init` walks you through it in English or Spanish, no YAML editing.

## Who Jobfaro is for

1. **New grads** — college graduates in their 20s landing their first professional role.
2. **People breaking into the workforce** — including those without a degree, career-changers, and
   first-time job-seekers.

**Entry-level is the default**, but levels are **toggle-able**: include mid-level roles, or opt into senior
(which then ranks normally, no penalty).

## Why Jobfaro is different

- **American English + Spanish**, full parity (English primary) — across the CLI and the apps.
- **Scanner for US enterprise** — Workday + iCIMS first, plus Greenhouse/Lever/Ashby.
- **Discover → prescreen → evaluate pipeline** — `scan` finds and filters roles but **never scores them**; `jobfaro prescreen` screens hard gates (years required, active clearance, degree gates) **with a quoted reason — never silently** — and ranks the rest by skill overlap + freshness; the model's `jobfaro eval` scores fit **0–5** against your résumé and records an **Apply / Research / Don't** band. `jobfaro tui` shows discovered roles as *pending eval* until the model has scored them.
- **A warm contact beats a cold application** — `jobfaro outreach` builds LinkedIn people-search links (you browse and choose; Jobfaro never scrapes or sends), drafts stay yours to send, and the polite cadence — 2 people per role, ONE follow-up after 5+ business days, then stop — is enforced in code.
- **Region toggle** — Midwest by default; switch to Northeast/Southeast/Southwest/West/nationwide and the seeds, location filters, and search adapt.
- **Level toggle** — entry by default; mid first-class; senior opt-in (ranks normally when chosen).
- **A dedicated no-degree path** — surfaces skills-based, apprenticeship, and "or equivalent experience" roles.
- **Transferable-skills toggle** — for career-changers and new grads: credits genuine adjacent skills toward a role's requirements and treats an "X+ years in [field]" ask as bridgeable, not a hard wall — without lowering the bar (`transferable_skills` / `eval --transferable`).
- **Private by design** — local data + on-device model by default; no résumé ever hosted by us.
- **Fun, never fake** — the 📡 radar sweep animates every long-running step (scan, prescreen, eval,
  tailor, outreach drafts, calibrate, PDF render): honest tallies that grow as results land, measured
  ETAs and true elapsed time — never an invented percent. The same radar language is headed into the app.
- **Easy for anyone** — a guided, bilingual setup wizard for the CLI today; the fully-on-device iPhone
  app (TestFlight beta soon), then a friendly web app, for non-technical users.

## Next steps

The MVP cut line is long shipped (see the status above). What remains, in order: the **TestFlight beta**
of the iPhone app ([Phase 10 L6](ROADMAP.md#phase-10--fully-local-iphone-active-direction-locked-2026-07-08)
— account steps), the **npm publish + marketplace** listing and a **closed beta** of the CLI (name / org /
license calls tracked in [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md)), evaluator recalibration from real 👍/👎 feedback
(`jobfaro calibrate --feedback`, once N≥50–100 labels accumulate), then the **web app (jobfaro.ai)** and
**Android** on the same stack.
